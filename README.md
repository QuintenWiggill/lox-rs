# lox-rs
Rust implementation of the Lox programming language from the book, Crafting Interpreters.

Currently a work in progress. Functionality is limited to arithmetic calculations.

## How to use

The language is only able to parse arithmetic at the moment. To use:

`cargo run` for the REPL

`cargo run filename.txt` to parse a text file
